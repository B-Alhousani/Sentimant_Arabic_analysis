# Arabic Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on Arabic text using a machine learning pipeline. It demonstrates preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to classify sentiments effectively.

## Overview

The notebook walks through the end-to-end process of analyzing Arabic text data for sentiment classification. It includes:
- Text cleaning and normalization (tokenization, stemming, removing stop words, etc.)
- Building and comparing several machine learning models
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Visualizing results for deeper insight

## Features

- Support for Arabic language preprocessing
- Comparison of multiple classifiers: Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Random Forest
- Graph mining and visual analysis of text data
- Evaluation metrics for model performance

## How to Run

This notebook is designed to run on **Google Colab**.

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Ensure required libraries are installed (most are handled within the notebook)
3. Follow the cells step-by-step to replicate the analysis

## Output

The notebook outputs:
- Accuracy scores and performance comparisons of different models
- Visual graphs showing model results and sentiment trends
